Math's Explained :-
Any number where it's digits add to 9 is always divisible by 9. (18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, etc.) Therefore the 'digital root' for any number divisible by 9 is always 9. You can see this even in larger numbers like 99 because 9 + 9 = 18, and then 1 + 8 = 9 still, so the root always becomes 9 for any numbers divisible by 9.

Additionally, 0 always has a digital root of 0 obviously.

The only other cases you need to worry about to find the digital root are when it isn't 0 or 9.

So for any number that isn't 0 and isn't divisible by 9, the root will always n % 9 for a given number n. (AKA the difference between given number n and the nearest number that is divisible by 9, since numbers divisible by 9 always have a digital root of 9).
For examples: 100 % 9 = 1 (one greater than 99, which is divisible by 9).
101 % 9 = 2
102 % 9 = 3 and so on.

This explanation/algorithm skips the whole "add digits until there is only 1 remaining", so the description of this problem seems pretty misleading to me since it makes you think the solution will be something unrelated to the optimal one. I guess the point of Leetcode is to learn all of these tricks though.
